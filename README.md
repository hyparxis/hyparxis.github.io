# Pedro's Blog

This is my personal website/blog. The bulk of the styling and 'about me' section of the website is based off a fork of the excellent [research-website-template](https://github.com/tovacinni/research-website-template). I've taken that template and essentially recreated jekyll's static blog functionality with the following added features:

- Static serving with github pages
- An auto-populated markdown blog section based on MDX
- LaTeX rendering via katex
- A comment section via utteranc.es
- Syntax highligthing via rehype-pretty-code
- A top navbar to switch between blog and about me sections

Feel free to fork this and make whatever changes you want for your own website; I've preserved research-website-template's MIT license. Big thanks to [Towaki](https://github.com/tovacinni) for the original template.
