This is just a temporary post to test the blog. In the near future I'd like to make real posts on the following topics:

- Deriving the equations of classical mechanics from first principles
- Computing log probabilities and running policy gradient algorithms on diffusion policies
- Implementing a quadratic programming based whole body controller for a humanoid (handling closed loops)
- Modeling brushless motors and field oriented control in a rigid body simulation
- Parallelizing the hydroelastic contact model
- A survey of intuitive perspectives on attention in transformers
