The goal of this














The equations of motion describe how a physical system evolves over time. A powerful way to derive them is through the **principle of least action**, which provides a unified framework for classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and field theory.

## The Action and the Lagrangian

The **Lagrangian** of a system is defined as the difference between kinetic energy $T$ and potential energy $V$:

$$
L = T - V.
$$

For a system described by a generalized coordinate $q$ and its velocity $\dot{q}$, the **action functional** is defined as

$$
S[q] = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(q, \dot{q}, t) \, dt.
$$

The **principle of least action** states that the path a system takes between two points in configuration space is the one that makes $S[q]$ stationary. This condition leads to the **Euler–Lagrange equation**:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} \right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} = 0.
$$

This equation provides the equations of motion for any system, given its Lagrangian.

## Example: A Mass–Spring System

Consider a simple mass–spring system with displacement $x(t)$. The kinetic energy is

$$
T = \frac{1}{2} m \dot{x}^2,
$$

and the potential energy stored in the spring (with stiffness $k$) is

$$
V = \frac{1}{2} k x^2.
$$

Thus, the Lagrangian is

$$
L = T - V = \frac{1}{2} m \dot{x}^2 - \frac{1}{2} k x^2.
$$

Applying the Euler–Lagrange equation:

1. Compute $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}}$:

   $$
   \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}} = m \dot{x}.
   $$

2. Differentiate with respect to time:

   $$
   \frac{d}{dt} \left( m \dot{x} \right) = m \ddot{x}.
   $$

3. Compute $\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}$:

   $$
   \frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = - k x.
   $$

Setting up the Euler–Lagrange equation:

$$
m \ddot{x} + k x = 0.
$$

This is the well-known equation for **simple harmonic motion**, with angular frequency $\omega = \sqrt{k/m}$.

## Conclusion

The Lagrangian formalism provides a systematic way to derive equations of motion from energy principles. This approach extends naturally to systems with multiple degrees of freedom, constraints, and even relativistic or quantum systems.

By formulating mechanics through the **principle of least action**, we gain a deep connection between classical mechanics and more advanced theories in physics.
